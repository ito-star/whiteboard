# Whatboard Terms of Service

**DATE OF LAST UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 5, 2020**

Please read these Whatboard terms of service ( **"Terms of Service"** ) carefully. These
Terms of Service govern your access to and use of the Whatboard cloud-based
application available at [whatboard.app](https://whatboard.app), and any updates, upgrades, modified versions,
extensions, improvements and derivative works of the foregoing (collectively, the
**"Service"** ). Whatboard LLC is an Illinois corporation and in these Terms of Service, we
will reference ourselves as **"Whatboard"** or **"we"** / **"us"**. By creating an account on the
Service, accessing and/or using the Service, you irrevocably agree to these Terms of
Service. These Terms of Service govern your use of and Whatboard's provision of the
Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you may not create an account
on, access or use, the Service.

**"You"** means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or Service or, if that
does not apply, you individually. If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or
another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind
your employer or such entity to these Terms of Service; (ii) you have read and
understand these Terms or Service; and (iii) you agree to these Terms of Service on
behalf of the party that you represent.

1. ## User Account Registration

   1. ### Account Registration and Use License:

      In order to access and use all of the features
      of the Service, you are required to open an account ( **"User Account"** ) by registering
      with Whatboard. When you register for your User Account you must provide true,
      accurate, current and complete information ( **"Account Information"** ), and you agree to
      update the Account Information in order to ensure that it is current. Upon proper
      registration and opening of a User Account, and subject to all of the terms and
      conditions of these Terms of Service, Whatboard hereby grants to you the personal,
      non-transferable right and license to use the Service, solely for your own internal
      business purposes, until such time as either you or Whatboard elect to terminate such
      right in accordance with these Terms of Service.

   1. ### Eligibility:

      As an express condition of being permitted to open a User Account, you
      represent and warrant that you (i) have the legal capacity (including, without limitation,
      being of sufficient age) to enter into contracts under the law of the jurisdiction in which
      you reside, (ii) are not on a list of persons barred you from receiving services under U.S.
      laws (including, without limitation, the Denied Persons List and the Entity List issued by
      the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security) or other applicable
      jurisdiction and (iii) are not a resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.

   1. ### Credentials:

      Upon registration for a User Account, you will provide Whatboard with a
      user ID and password to access your account. You are responsible for maintaining the
      confidentiality of your password and for all of your activities and those of any third party
      that occur through your account, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to
      immediately notify Whatboard of any suspected or actual unauthorized use of your User
      Account. You agree that Whatboard will not under any circumstances be liable for any
      cost, loss, damages or expenses arising out of a failure by you to maintain the security
      of your password.

2. ## Fees, Term and Termination

   1. ### Fees:

      Some features of the Service may only be accessed and used upon the
      payment of applicable fees ( **"Fees"** ). Fees may vary depending on usage in
      accordance with our current pricing policy available in the Service or on the Site. If you
      do not initially register for a version of the Service that requires the payment of a fee,
      you will nonetheless be permitted to use all of the features of the Service for the trial
      period expressly stated at the time you signed up for the trial period use of the Service
      ( **"Free Trial Period"** ). NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN, ANY
      SERVICE PROVIDED DURING THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD IS PROVIDED **"AS-IS"**
      WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDEMNITIES. Upon the
      expiration of the Free Trial Period, you will only be able to access and use those
      features of the Service the use of which does not require the payment of a Fee, unless
      you subsequently upgrade to a paid version of the Service. All Fees are exclusive of all
      taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you are solely responsible for
      payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or
      state) taxes.

   1. ### Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading:

      Refunds are processed according to our fair
      refund policy. Any changes in your Service usage that result in any new, increase or
      decrease in Fees as specified in our current pricing policy available in the Service or on
      the Site, will be charged at the next billing cycle. There will be no prorating for
      downgrades in between billing cycles. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of
      features or capacity of your User Account. Whatboard does not accept any liability for
      such loss.

   1. ### Cancellation and Termination by You:

      You are solely responsible for properly
      canceling your User Account. An email or phone request to cancel your User Account is
      not considered cancellation. You can cancel your User Account at any time by clicking
      on the settings link in the global navigation bar at the top of the Service screen. The
      settings screen provides a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. If you cancel
      your User Account before the end of your current paid up applicable subscription term,
      your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. Please
      note that we do not provide refunds for unused time in the last billing cycle.

   1. ### Termination, Rate Limiting, and Suspension by Whatboard:

      Whatboard may rate limit or terminate your User
      Account and/or these Terms of Service at any time and for any reason upon notice to
      you. We may also suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If we
      terminate your User Account without cause, we will refund a prorated portion of your
      monthly prepayment. We will not refund or reimburse you if we terminate your User
      Account for cause, including (without limitation) for a violation of these Terms of Service
      or the Acceptable Use Policy.

   1. ### Effect of Termination:

      Once your User Account is terminated, we may permanently
      delete your User Account and any or all User Content associated with it. If you do not
      log in to your User Account for 12 or more months, we may treat your User Account as
      **"inactive"** and permanently delete the User Account and all the data associated with it.
      Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by
      either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other
      remedies it may have under these Terms of Service. All sections of these Terms of
      Service which by their nature should survive termination will survive, including without
      limitation, accrued rights to payment, use restrictions and indemnity obligations,
      confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

   (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OR PROFITS,

   limitations specified in this Section 8 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in
   contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply
   even if any limited remedy specified in these Terms of Service is found to have failed of
   its essential purpose.

10. ## Confidential Information

    1. ### Confidential Information:

       Each party ( **"Disclosing Party"** ) may disclose
       **"Confidential Information"** to the other party ( **"Receiving Party"** ) in connection with
       the Service, which is anything that reasonably should be understood to be confidential
       given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, as well as
       non-public business, product, technology and marketing information. If something is
       labeled **"Confidential,"** that's a clear indicator to the Receiving Party that the material
       is confidential. Notwithstanding the above, Confidential Information does not include
       information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of any
       obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its
       disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the
       Disclosing Party; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed
       to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party.

    1. ### Protection and use of Confidential Information:

       The Receiving Party will (a) take at
       least reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential
       Information, and limit access to those employees, affiliates and contractors who need to
       know such information in connection with the Service; and (b) not use or disclose any
       Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of the
       Service and these Terms of Service. Nothing above will prevent either party from
       sharing Confidential Information with financial and legal advisors; provided, however,
       that the advisors are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those
       in the Contract.

    1. ### Compelled access or disclosure:

       The Receiving Party may access or disclose
       Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is required by law; provided,
       however, that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the
       compelled access or disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable
       assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the
       access or disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to access or disclose
       the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the
       Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing access to such
       Confidential Information as well as the reasonable cost for any support provided in
       connection with the Disclosing Party seeking a protective order or confidential treatment
       for the Confidential Information to be produced.

11. ## Additional Services

    1. ### Whatboard Teams and Whatboard Companies Accounts:

       Service is for the Whatboard Teams or Whatboard Companies package of the Service
       (each a **"Team Account"** ), the following additional terms apply: Each Team Account
       will have an administrator who can accept or remove Team Account members. By
       agreeing to join a Team Account, you acknowledge that (i) your identity, including

       usage, and (ii) your User Content will be viewable by all Team Account members. You
       will have the option to share with other Team Account members any content you have
       created and/or any Third Party Service with which you have connected. If you share

       Party Service with which you have connected, all Team Account members will have
       read/write access to the data associated with such Third Party Service.

12. ## Location of the Service and Your Use

    Whatboard operates or controls the operation of the Service from a cloud service
    located in the United States. In addition, the Service, User Content and Your Posts may
    be accessed, mirrored and/or managed from various locations outside the United

13. ## Notices

    Whatboard may give notice applicable to Whatboard's general Service customer base
    by means of a general notice on the Service portal, and notices specific to you by
    electronic mail to your e-mail address on record in your User Account or by written
    communication sent by first class mail or pre-paid post to your address on record in
    your User Account. You are responsible for ensuring that your contact information is
    accurate and up to date in your User Account. If you have a dispute with Whatboard,
    wish to provide a notice under these Terms of Service, or become subject to insolvency
    or other similar legal proceedings, you must promptly send written notice to Whatboard
    at Whatboard LLC, 1500 Skokie Blvd, Suite 310, Northbrook IL 60062.

14. ## Modifications to Terms of Service

    Whatboard expressly reserves the right to modify the Terms of Service at any time in its
    sole discretion by including such alteration and/or modification in these Terms of
    Service, along with a notice of the effective date of such modified Terms of Service. If a
    revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you
    (by, for example, through your User Account or in the Service itself). To the extent you
    have purchased a subscription to the Service, the modified terms will be effective as to
    such subscription Service upon the earlier of (i) your next subscription renewal, or (ii)
    your acceptance of the modified Terms of Service by clicking **"Accept"** (or similar
    button or checkbox) at the time you are presented with the modified Terms of Service. If
    you object to the updated Terms of Service, as your exclusive remedy, you may choose
    not to renew, including cancelling any terms set to auto-renew. In all other cases, any
    continued use by you of the Service after the posting of such modified Terms of Service
    shall be deemed to indicate your irrevocable agreement to such modified Terms of
    Service.

15. ## General

    These Terms of Service and the policies or terms expressly referenced and
    incorporated into these Terms of Service, (e.g. the [Acceptable Use Policy](/acceptable-use)) constitute
    the entire agreement and understanding between the parties concerning the subject
    matter hereof, notwithstanding any different or additional terms that may be contained in
    the form of purchase order or other document used by you to place orders or otherwise
    effect transactions hereunder, which such terms are hereby rejected. Neither party may
    assign these Terms of Service without the prior written approval of the other, such
    approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that such approval shall
    not be required in connection with an assignment to an affiliate or to a successor to
    substantially all of such party's assets or business related to these Terms of Service.
    These Terms of Service supersede all prior or contemporaneous discussions, proposals
    and agreements between you and Whatboard relating to the subject matter hereof. If
    any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
    remaining portions will remain in full force and effect and such provision will be enforced
    to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and will be
    reformed to the extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. No
    waiver of rights by either party may be implied from any actions or failures to enforce
    rights under these Terms of Service or the [Acceptable Use Policy](/acceptable-use). These Terms of
    Service and the [Acceptable Use Policy](/acceptable-use) are intended to be and are solely for the benefit
    of Whatboard and you and do not create any right in favor of any third party. These
    Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
    State of Illinois, without reference to its conflict of laws principles. The Uniform
    Computer Information Transactions Act will not apply to this Agreement. All disputes
    arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service will be submitted to the exclusive
    jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction located in Lake County, Illinois (USA), and each
    party irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this
    venue.
